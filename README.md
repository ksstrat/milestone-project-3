# Battleship
## Overview
Welcome to Battleship!
This is a adaptation of the naval strategy game, playable directly in the terminal. Engage in a tactical battle against a computer opponent, strategically deploying your fleet and hunting down enemy vessels. The game features a clean, text-based interface with colored output for an enhanced user experience.

## **Planning stage**

### **Target Audiences**
* Players who enjoy classic strategy board games.
* Users looking for a simple, text-based game to play in a terminal environment.
* Individuals interested in a demonstration of object-oriented programming principles in Python applied to game development.
* Casual gamers seeking a quick and engaging single-player experience.

### **User Stories**
* As a user, i want to start a new game of Battleship against the computer.
* As a user, i want to be able to view the game rules before play.
* As a user, i want to enter my name for a personalized experience.
* As a user, i want to choose to place my ships manually or have them placed randomly.
* As a user, i want to receive clear feedback on what is happening at every stage of the game.
* As a user, i just want to have a good time with Battleships!

### **How This Will Be Accomplished**
* This game is implemented entirely in Python, utilizing an object-oriented programming (OOP) paradigm
* All interactions and game display occur within the command-line terminal.
* Once the players have entered their names, they can choose whether to start the game immediately or read the rules first.
* Players can either place their ships on the board themselves or choose to have them distributed randomly.
* Players receive clear visual feedback at every stage of the game.
* If the player makes an input that is not intended, he receives clear feedback and can repeat the input.
